    "   - Stores updated values for analysis.\n",

    "The plot above shows the **steady-state amplitude as a function of the driving frequency** for different damping values. Several important trends can be observed:\n",

    "\n",
    "## **6.4.1 Observed Trends**\n",
    "### **🔹 Case 1: No Damping ($ b = 0 $)**\n",
    "- The **resonance peak is very sharp and high**, meaning that when $ \\omega_{\\text{drive}} \\approx \\omega_0 $, the system absorbs energy efficiently and oscillates with **large amplitude**.\n",
    "- This is expected because there is **no energy loss** due to damping, allowing continuous energy buildup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Case 2: Light Damping ($ b < b_{\\text{cr}} $)**\n",
    "- The resonance peak **is still present but lower** compared to the undamped case.\n",
    "- The system still absorbs energy near resonance, but **some energy is dissipated** due to damping.\n",
    "- The frequency at which maximum amplitude occurs **shifts slightly to the left** of $ \\omega_0 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Case 3: Moderate to Heavy Damping ($ b \\approx b_{\\text{cr}} $ and $ b > b_{\\text{cr}} $)**\n",
    "- The resonance peak is **significantly reduced**.\n",
    "- As damping increases, **energy dissipation dominates over resonance effects**.\n",
    "- The system still oscillates but never reaches large amplitudes, even near $ \\omega_0 $.\n",
    "- The peak amplitude occurs at **a frequency lower than $ \\omega_0 $**.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6.4.2 Comparison with Theoretical Predictions**\n",
    "### **Theoretical Resonance Amplitude**\n",
    "The theoretical amplitude response for a damped driven harmonic oscillator is:\n",

    "- $ b $ is the damping coefficient,\n",

    "### **Comparison with Our Results**\n",
    "✔ The **numerical results match the theoretical expectations**:\n",
    "- The **peak amplitude decreases as damping increases**.\n",
    "- The **resonance peak shifts left** as damping increases.\n",
    "- The **overall response curve shape** is consistent with theoretical resonance curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ **Small deviations** between the numerical and theoretical results may arise due to:\n",
