    "## 2.1 Defining a General Simulation Framework\n",
    "Before implementing specific numerical methods, we establish a base class that models the general behavior of a mass-spring-damper system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of the `Simulation` Class\n",
    "The `Simulation` class serves as a general framework for solving the system’s equations of motion. It:  \n",
    "- Stores key system parameters such as mass, spring constant, damping coefficient, and initial conditions.  \n",
    "- Defines a `simulate()` function to handle time evolution.  \n",
    "- Uses `force_at_time()` to compute restoring forces, damping, and external driving forces.  \n",
    "- Provides an abstract method `simulate_at_index()`, which is overridden by specific numerical methods to implement their update rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Simulation Works\n",
    "1. The system starts at position $x_0$ and velocity $v_0$.  \n",
    "2. The simulation steps through time:  \n",
    "   - `simulate_at_index()` computes position and velocity updates.  \n",
    "   - External and damping forces are evaluated using `force_at_time()`.  \n",
    "   - Updated values are stored for analysis.  \n",
    "3. The function returns simulation data, including position, velocity, acceleration, and time arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach ensures that all numerical solvers share a common framework, improving code organization, reusability, and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we define the `Simulation` class below."
